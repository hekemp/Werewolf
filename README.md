# Werewolf

#An iOS game for devious people.
A peer-to-peer <a href="https://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/">Werewolf</a> game for iOS, written with Multipeer Connectivity in Swift 4.0 for Xcode 9.

This project is unaffiliated with the people behind Werewolf. It was created by some college students for an iOS Development class in Fall 2017, and then expanded further into a project during our free time.
